## What is BigData? 

- BigData is data which is beyond storage and processing capacity of conventional databases.
- data size is in TBs
- Sources:  
  - Social Networking Sites - Fb, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.
  - Mobile devices- calls data, apps data etc.
  - Internet Transactions - purchases, banking activities
  - N/w Devices/Sensors - Temperature, weather forecasting

## BigData Characteristics (5 V's)

- **Volume** or Size of Data is Huge
- **Velocity** - Processing speed of data - bigdata requires high processing speed since vol is high
- **Variety** - contains different types of data : text, voice, images etc. 
- **Value** - should be worth of data being extracted 
- **Veracity** -  what is accuracy of data collected

## What is Hadoop? 

- Whenever we pull data to DWH from multiple sources it's usually in large volume and diff types 
- In order to maintain this data, traditional db systems are not capable so we need to go for **Hadoop Systems.** 
- Hadoop is technology for storing and processing huge data volumes.
  - it's based on Apache Framework 
  - recommended for huge data sets but not smaller sets
  - It uses commodity hardware and cluster concepts .i.e, collection of multiple systems used together.
  - We can generate BI reports directly from hadoop

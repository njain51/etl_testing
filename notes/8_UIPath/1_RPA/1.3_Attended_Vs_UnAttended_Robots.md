# Attended vs UnAttended Robots Workflow

- Robots:
    - Attended Process
        - machine is open then robot will work, means it requires human intervention
        - A type of robot working on the same machines as the humans, during the same hours. They are triggered directly by humans (usually through UiPath Assistant) or by an event related to what the human user does.

- UnAttended Process
  - even when machine is locked it will work , it can run independently
  - A robot typically deployed on a separate machine than any human user. Their jobs are triggered exclusively from Orchestrator. 
  - we can only schedule unattended process

## What's the relation between Attended Robot and Assistant?
- Right now, UiPath Assistant is an interface between the human user and the attended robot. It's the default way used to run and customize jobs in attended mode

# Difference between Scenario Outline & Data Table

**Scenario Outline:**

- This uses Example keyword to define the test data for the Scenario
- This works for the whole test
- Cucumber automatically run the complete test the number of times equal to the number of data in the Test Set



**Test Data**:

- No keyword is used to define the test data
- This works only for the single step, below which it is defined
- A separate code needs to understand the test data and then it can be run single or multiple times but again just for the single step, not for the complete test

- the Data Tables can be used in many ways because it has provided many different methods to use.

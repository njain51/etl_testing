# Running Same Test case with Different Data

- In Cucumber we may have same scenario to be run many times by passing different values
- For example for login.feature we are passing different values for username and password 
- whenever we have same scenario but data is changing, then we put data in double quotes
- In this case same stepDefinition method will need to be run   which can accept different values. 
- Note that function arguments should match with number of parameters passed
```text
    @And("he login with username {string} and password {string}")
    public void heLoginWithUsernameAndPassword(String arg0, String arg1) {
        System.out.println("User login with username " + arg0+ "and password " +arg1 );

    }
// two arguments: arg0 and arg1 for two string values     

```

## What is Cucumber?

- its BDD(Behavior Driven Development) framework for running automated tests 
- it doesn't automate our testcases 
- All kinds of TestCases written in Java/Ruby are supported by Cucumber: 
  - web test cases
  - mobile testing
  - API testing
  - unit testing etc.

- **Benefits**:
  - Data Driven
    - driving data from external files, 
    - fill form from external source
  - Parameterization
    - Scripts with multiple set of data
  - Execution Controls
    - run multiple times
    - out of 1000 testcases we can selectively pick 100 
    - can run few regression tests at a time out of many.
  - Hooks
  - Reports
  - Automation Utilities etc.

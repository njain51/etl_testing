# Data handling in Cucumber using data table

example scenario
```text
Scenario: Correct non-zero number of books found by author
  Given I have the a book in the store called The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson
  When I search for books by author Erik Larson
  Then I find 1 book
```

- While inline data suffices for a single book, our scenario can become cluttered when adding multiple books. To handle this, we create a data table in our scenario:
```text
Scenario: Correct non-zero number of books found by author
  Given I have the following books in the store
    | The Devil in the White City          | Erik Larson |
    | The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe | C.S. Lewis  |
    | In the Garden of Beasts              | Erik Larson |
  When I search for books by author Erik Larson
  Then I find 2 books
```
- We define our data table as a part of our Given clause by indenting the table underneath the text of the Given clause. 

- Using this data table, we can add an arbitrary number of books — including only a single book — to our store by adding or removing rows.
- When clarification is needed, we can include a header by adding a new first row:
Note: Cucumber does not differentiate between headings and row data for a list of lists.So when parsing the list we need to take care of it explicitly.
```text
Scenario: Correct non-zero number of books found by author
  Given I have the following books in the store
    | title                                | author      |
    | The Devil in the White City          | Erik Larson |
    | The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe | C.S. Lewis  |
    | In the Garden of Beasts              | Erik Larson |
  When I search for books by author Erik Larson
  Then I find 2 books
```

- In the case of a step that contains a data table, we implement our methods with a DataTable argument:
```text
@Given("some phrase")
public void somePhrase(DataTable table) {
    // ...
}
```
- The DataTable object contains the tabular data from the data table we defined in our scenario, as well as methods for transforming this data into usable information. Generally, there are three ways to transform a data table in Cucumber: 
  - (1) a list of lists, example [here](https://github.com/njain51/cucumber-demo/tree/1.0.5)
  - (2) a list of maps, and 
  - (3) a table transformer.

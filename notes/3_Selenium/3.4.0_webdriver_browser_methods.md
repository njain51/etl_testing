# WebDriver browser methods:

- getting URL 
```text
// get current URL
System.out.println(webDriver.getCurrentUrl());      
```
- getting page source
```text
// get page source : to deal with some UI components, its useful for some websites where right click is disabled
System.out.println(webDriver.getPageSource());
```

- browse to another website and then come back to first one
- if this is not working, it may be bug in browser, we may use Thread.sleep() to fix it. 
```text
        // browser to another website
        webDriver.get("https://www.yahoo.com/");
        System.out.println(webDriver.getTitle());

       // navigate back to first one
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        webDriver.navigate().back();
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        System.out.println(webDriver.getTitle());

        // navigate to yahoo again
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        webDriver.navigate().forward();
        System.out.println(webDriver.getTitle());
```

- driver.close() vs driver.quit()
  - close will just close the current browser while quit will close all open browsers

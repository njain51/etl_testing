- After we trigger the test, complete selenium code(**Client**) will be converted to JSON format
- Generated Json will be sent to browser driver(**Server**) via http protocol.Each browser contain separate browser driver. example: Chrome will have Chrome driver, firefox will have firefox driver etc.

- Browser driver communicate with its respective browser and execute the commands on the browser by interpreting Json which is received.
- Browser driver receive response back from the browser and it sends Json response back to client.

Note:
  - this Chrome browser driver are available for download and we need to provide path in the Selenium Script else Script will not know where to send json code to browser.
